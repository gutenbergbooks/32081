<p>Kieff has been retaken by the Bolshevists.
It looks as if the Poles will
have to win the place three times in
succession before it becomes their own
property.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Annoyed by a small boy who was
sucking sweets and laughing a parson
recently stopped in the middle of his
sermon and refused to go on with it.
We are informed that the boy in question
has since received several tempting
offers from other parishes.</p>

<p>A motorist, summoned the other week,
admitted to having knocked three people
down one day and
two people the next.
If only this progress

<hr class="short" />

<p>Traffic in Finsbury
Park was considerably
delayed the other
day by a crowd which
collected in the main
street in order to
watch two bricklayers
who had deliberately
removed their coats.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A weekly paper
states that the winding
up of the Ministry
of Munitions will not
be completed until
next year. After all it
is just as well not to

<p>A New York writer thinks that a man

On the contrary, in these days, just as
he gets the last one married off, the first
gets a divorce and comes back home.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"The secret of health," said Professor
<span class="sc">Darsonval</span> of the French Academy of

travellers of walking on other people's.</p>

<p>At the Business Exhibition there was

<p>"In 1924," says a contemporary,
"Mars will be only thirty-five million

has the matter in hand.</p>

<p>Scotland Yard is warning people
against a man who perpetrates fraud
by means of the telephone. It is to be

the secret of how he gets through can
be wrested from him.</p>

<p>"An expedition in search for gold,"
says a contemporary, "will leave Glasgow
next week." In view of their

have decided to leave Scotland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Robert Hyde</span>, a chemist of Pittsburg,
claims to have obtained sugar
from sawdust. This is not so very
remarkable. Several people in this
country have succeeded in obtaining
sugar from a grocer.</p>

<p>During a recent debate
on crime a well-known
doctor stated
that, although his

the secretary of the

<h2>THE ART OF POETRY.</h2>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>In this lecture I shall deal with the
production of Lyrics, Blank Verse and
(if I am allowed) Hymns (Ancient and
Modern).</p>

<p>First we will write a humorous lyric
for the Stage, bearing in mind, of course,
the peculiar foibles, idiosyncrasies and
whims of Mr. Alf Bubble, who will sing
it (we hope). Mr. Bubble's principal
source of fun is the personal appearance
of his fellow-citizens. Whenever a new
character comes on the stage he makes
some remark about the character's
"face." Whenever he does this the
entire audience rolls about on its seat,
and cackles and gurgles and wipes its
eyes, and repeats in a hoarse whisper,
with variations of its own, the uproarious
phrasing of Mr. Bubble's remark.
If Mr. Bubble says, "But look at his
<i>face</i>!" the audience, fearful lest its
neighbours may have missed the cream
of the thing, splutters hysterically in
the intervals of eye-wiping and coughing
and choking and sneezing, "He
said, '<i>What</i> a face!'" or "He said, '<i>Did</i>
you <i>see</i> his face?'" or "He said, 'Is it
a <i>face</i>?'"</p>

<p>All this we have got to remember
when we are writing a lyric for
Mr. Bubble. Why Mr. Bubble of all
people should find so much mirth in
other men's faces I can't say, but there
it is. If we write a song embodying
this great joke we may be certain that
it will please Mr. Bubble; so we will
do it.</p>

<p>Somebody, I think, will have made
some slighting remark about the
Government, and that will give the
cue for the first verse, which will be
political.</p>

<p>We will begin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Thompson ....</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>I don't know why the people in humorous
lyrics are always called Thompson
(or Brown), but they are.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Thompson, being indigent,</p>
<p>Thought that it was time he went</p>
<p>Into England's Parliament,</p>
<p class="i4">To earn his daily bread ....</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>That is a joke against Parliament,
you see&mdash;Payment of Members and all
that; it is good. At the same time it
is usual to reserve one's jokes for the
chorus. The composer, you see, reserves
his tune for the chorus, and, if
the author puts too much into the
verse, there will be trouble between
their Unions.</p>

<p>Now we introduce the <i>face-motif</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Thompson's features were not neat;</p>
<p>When he canvassed dahn our street</p>
<p>Things were said I won't repeat,</p>
<p class="i4">And my old moth-ah said:&mdash;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>This verse, you notice, is both in
metre and rhyme; I don't know how
that has happened; it ought not to be.</p>

<p>Now we have the chorus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">"Oh, Mr. Thompson,</p>
<p class="i2">It isn't any good;</p>
<p>I shouldn't like to vote for you,</p>
<p class="i2">So I won't pretend I should;</p>
<p>I know that you're the noblest</p>
<p class="i2">Of all the human race ...."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>That shows the audience that <i>face</i>
is coming very soon, and they all get
ready to burst themselves.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"I haven't a doubt, if you get in,</p>
<p>The Golden Age will soon begin&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2"> But <span class="sc">I don't like</span>&mdash;your FACE."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>At this point several of the audience
will simply slide off their seats on to the
floor and wallow about there, snorting.</p>

<p>The next verse had better be a love-verse.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Thompson wooed a lovely maid</p>
<p>Every evening in the shade,</p>
<p>Meaning, I am much afraid,</p>
<p class="i4">To hide his ugly head ....</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p><i>Head</i> is not very good, I admit, but
we must have <i>said</i> in the last line, and
as we were mad enough to have rhymes
in the first verse we have got to go on
with it.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>But when he proposed one night&mdash;</p>
<p>Did it by electric light&mdash;</p>
<p>Mabel, who retained her sight,</p>
<p class="i4">Just looked at him and said:&mdash;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Now you see the idea?</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Oh, Mr. Thompson,</p>
<p class="i2">It isn't any good;</p>
<p>I shouldn't like to marry you,</p>
<p class="i2">So I won't pretend I should;</p>
<p>I know that you have riches</p>
<p class="i2">And a house in Eaton Place ....</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>(Here all the audience pulls out its
handkerchief)</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>I haven't a doubt that you must be</p>
<p>The properest possible match for me,</p>
<p class="i2">But <span class="sc">I don't like</span>&mdash;your FACE."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>I have got another verse to this song,
but I will not give it to you now, as I
think the Editor is rather bored with
it. It is fortunate for Mr. Bubble that
he does not have to perform before an
audience of Editors.</p>

<p>Having written the lyric the next
thing to do is to get a composer to compose
music for it and then you get it
published. This is most difficult, as composers
are people who don't ever keep
appointments, and music publishers
like locking up lyrics in drawers till the
mice have got at the chorus and the
whole thing is out of date.</p>

<p>By the time that this song is ready
Mr. Bubble may quite possibly have
exhausted the <i>face-motif</i> altogether
and struck a new vein. Then we shall
have wasted our labour. In that case
we will arrange to have it buried in
somebody's grave (Mr. Bubble's for
choice), and in 2000 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> it will be dug
up by antiquaries and deciphered. Even
a lyric like this may become an Old
Manuscript in time. I ought to add that
I myself have composed the music for
this lyric, but I really cannot undertake
to explain composing as well as
poetry.</p>

<p>The serious lyric or Queen's Hall
Ballad is a much easier affair. But
I must first warn the student that
there are some peculiar customs attaching
to this traffic which may at
first sight appear discouraging. When
you have written a good lyric and induced
someone to compose a tune for
it your first thought will be, "I will
get Mr. Throstle to sing this, and he
will pay me a small fee or royalty per
performance;" and this indeed would
be a good arrangement to make. The
only objection is that Mr. Throstle, so
far from paying any money to the
student, will expect to be paid about
fifty pounds by the student for singing
his lyric. I do not know the origin of
this quaint old custom, but the student
had better not borrow any money on
the security of his first lyric.</p>

<p>For a serious or Queen's Hall lyric
all that is necessary is to think of some
natural objects like the sun, the birds,
the flowers or the trees, mention them
briefly in the first verse and then in the
second verse draw a sort of analogy or
comparison between the natural object
and something to do with love. The
verses can be extremely short, since in
this class of music the composer is
allowed to spread himself indefinitely
and can eke out the tiniest words.</p>

<p>Here is a perfect lyric I have written.
It is called, quite simply, <i>Evening</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Sunshine in the forest,</p>
<p class="i2">Blossom on the tree,</p>
<p>And all the brave birds singing</p>
<p class="i2">For you&mdash;and me.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Kisses in the sunshine,</p>
<p class="i2">Laughter in the dew,</p>
<p>And all the brave world singing</p>
<p class="i2">For me&mdash;and you.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>I see now that the dew has got into
the second verse, so it had better be
called quite simply <i>The Dawn</i>.</p>

<p style="float: right"><i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, Act III., Sc. 1.</p></div>

<p>You notice the artistic parallelism of
this lyric; I mean, "The brave birds
singing" in one verse and "The brave
<i>world</i> singing" in the next. That is a
tip I got from Hebrew poetry, especially
the Psalms: "One day telleth another;
and one night certifieth another," and so
on. It is a useful trick to remember, and
is employed freely by many modern
writers, the author of "The King's
Regulations," for example, who in
Regulation 1680 has the fine line:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Disembarkations are carried out in a
similar manner to embarkations."
</p></blockquote>

<p>That goes well to the Chant in C major by Mr. <span class="sc">P. Humphreys</span>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page483" id="page483"></a>[pg 483]</span>

<p>But I am wandering. It is becoming
clear to me now that I shall not have time
to do Blank Verse or Hymns (Ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page484" id="page484"></a>[pg 484]</span>
and Modern) in this lecture, after all,
so I will give you a rough outline of
that special kind of lyric, the Topical
Song. All that is required for this class
of work is a good refrain or central idea;
when you have got that, you see how
many topics you can tack on to it.
But if you can tack on Mr. <span class="sc">Winston
Churchill</span> you need not bother about
the others.</p>

<p>Our central idea will be "Rations,"
and the song will be called <i>Heaps and
Heaps</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>All you have to do now is to work in
some more topics. I don't think I shall

<h3>NEW MODES FOR MARS.</h3>

<p>The anti-scarlet fever raging throughout
the country is causing the Government
the deepest concern, and many
schemes for modifying the present
khaki uniform of our troops, instead of
reverting to the old red and blue for
ceremonial wear, have, it is well known,
been under consideration by the tailoring
experts of Whitehall. Bright and
brainy as are most of the projects, we
are authorised to state that the following
memorandum at present holds the
field, being considered to provide the
greatest measure of economy and utility,
nattiness and hygiene.</p>

<hr />

<p>The flat-topped service cap (to begin
with the private's head) is to undergo
considerable alterations, the crown becoming
dome-shaped, the peak disappearing
and a brim being added eight
inches wide and curving deeply downwards.
This detail will be carried out
for summer in chip-straw, for winter
in crown velours, and completed with
a ribbon in the regimental colours (to
take the place of the regimental badge),
with two streamers in the rear, like those
of the Glengarry bonnet, but greater in
length and width. The chin-strap will
be made of white elastic, but not pipeclayed,
and worn permanently round the chin.</p>

<hr />

<p>Owing to the expense of brass buttons
and the bother of cleaning them the S.D.
frock will cease to be worn, a Cardigan
taking its place both for winter and
summer use. The old shades of grey-brown
elephant and mole will disappear,
but in deference to the views of
the pacifists a pale pink will be substituted
for the unpopular red. White
facings will surround the collar, cuffs
and bottom edge of this garment, which
will extend to a depth of eight-and-a-half
inches above the knee-cap. If side-arms
are worn they will be of a miniature
size and suspended round the neck
to hang in front by means of a lariat
decorated with coral beads. Non-commissioned
rank will be indicated by
bangles round the right wrist.</p>

<hr />

<p>Service trousers and puttees are both
clumsy in appearance and awkward
to put on, and will be replaced by a
variant of the Scottish kilt, navy blue
in colour and without the sporran or
pleats. Under this will be worn pink
socks, supporting the <i>motif</i> of the Cardigan,
and, instead of the ammunition
boot, tan shoes, fastened by means of a
single cross strap and button, a mechanism
which can be taken down and
reassembled with remarkable ease.</p>

<hr />

<p>A small haversack will be carried by
a cord attachment in the right hand,
and will contain the following items of
small kit:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="none">
<li>One housewife.</li>

<li style="margin-right: 15%;">One hold-all. [This will be filled with
the usual toilet requisites, including a
toothbrush, to be employed for the first
time, in view of the abolition of brass
buttons, for the purpose of brushing
the teeth.]</li>

<li>One front hair glass.</li>

<li>One back ditto.</li>

<li>Six safety-pins.</li>

<li>One tin shoe-cream.</li>

<li>One tin face-cream.</li>
</ul>

<p>It will be compulsory to shave the
upper lip, but, in order to minimise expense
at the barber's shop, the hair
will be worn not less than ten inches
in length and brushed with a downward
and backward movement of the right
hand away from the crown, so as to
leave the forehead clear and conceal
the ears.</p>

<p>White cotton gloves will be worn,
one on each hand.</p>

<h3>II.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Middle-Class Mother.</span></h3>

<h4><i>By Lady Vi Fitzermine, Leader of Society's Revels.</i></h4>

<p>Are we growing dull? That is a question which in
these pip-inducing times of peace one is frequently constrained
to ask; and in the view of many, I fear, there can
be but one answer.</p>

<p>During the late lamented War it was almost impossible
for any rightly constituted woman to experience the pangs
of boredom. When one wasn't making things vibrate in the
hospitals of France and Flanders there was always abundance
of excitement on the Home Front&mdash;flag-days, tableaux,
theatricals, dances and other junketings in aid of this or
that charity. And when the supply of charities threatened
to run dry it was always a simple matter to invent new
ones. All you had to do was to organise a drawing-room
meeting, put the names of the Allied nations in one hat
and of the more or less recognised necessaries of life in
another and draw out one paper from each receptacle.
You there and then registered a new charity out of the
result and advertised some thrillingly expensive form of
entertainment in support of the Society for the Supply of
Chewing-gum to the Czecho-Slovakians, or any other equally
pathetic cause.</p>

<p>In those days a charity began at an At Home and usually
ended at the Coliseum or the Albert Hall&mdash;or (in a few
unfortunate cases) in the Bankruptcy Court. Nowadays,
however, people are deplorably sceptical on the subject of
new appeals to the pocket, and many folk find time hanging
heavy on their hands in consequence. It is for us who are
of what I may call the organising class to break down the
walls of this growing prejudice, which, if not checked in
time, threatens to add seriously to the general volume of
unrest. Hence it is necessary to scrap a good many of our
old ideas and to realise that for all essential purposes the
exotic form of charity is played out. To-day a Society
woman who wishes to maintain her position as <i>arbiter
elegantiarum</i> must tap other sources of inspiration and
supply.</p>

<p>It is in these circumstances that I confidently fall back
upon the Middle-Class Mother. After all, who was always
the chief financial support of my wartime enterprises?
The Middle-Class Mother. It was to her heart that the cry
of the Croat, the moan of the Montenegrin, the ululation of
the Yugo-Slav made its most effective entry. It was she
who lavished her husband's pay or profits on the entrancing
vision of the Countess of Bustover as Britannia or of Lady
Aaronson as England's Girlhood. So I have determined
that she shall now have a show to herself, and we shall
see whether she will subscribe to her own charity as wholeheartedly
as she did to those of our suffering Allies.</p>

<p>Without a doubt the Middle-Class Mother is a very
deserving institution and has done extremely good work in
the past, which I regret that the space at my disposal does
not permit me to particularise. I must perforce content myself
with announcing that on her behalf a grand Zoological
Fancy Dress Ball will be held next month at Valhalla, which
will be converted for the occasion into a realistic representation
of a Bear Garden. I myself am appearing as
Queen of the Polar Bears, and by way of augmenting the
takings I propose to sell hugs at a guinea per head. The
whole of the proceeds, after the expenses have been deducted,
will go to the Middle-Class Mothers' Mutual Criticism
Society, an animated body of which I have the privilege
to be founder and hon. president.</p>

<h3>GETTING FIXED.</h3>

<p>"Now mind, my boy, what you've
got to do is to tell all your friends you
are out looking for a job, and they'll
give you introductions. Nothing like
'em; a friend at court, you know, and
all that." This was from one of the
friends to whom I had applied for a post.
The advice was all he had to offer me.</p>

<p>I acted on it, and found my friends
only too ready to give the required
introductions. With alacrity they minuted
me on from one to another till I
felt as if "passed to you, please" had
been scrawled all over me. But I
persevered, and eventually weeded out
from my list of introductions half-a-dozen
that were addressed to solid men,
high up in the City, who might be
counted on not to miss the chance of a
good thing. That is how in the early
days of the Peace I was disposed to regard
a demobilized young officer who
had worn red tabs.</p>

<p>The first name on my selected list
was John Pountney, of the firm of
Laurence, Pountney &amp; Co. My wife's
uncle had been at school with John
Pountney's brother, who unfortunately
had no connection with the firm. But
no matter; I filled up a form in the
outer office&mdash;"Nature of Business, personal"&mdash;and
sent it in with my note of
introduction attached. John Pountney
saw me. He did all the talking in
quite an affable manner, told me of his
son's experiences in the War, deplored
the high price of petrol and his wife's
difficulties in obtaining servants, and
then: "Well, let's get to business.
So you would like good employment in
the City? What can you do?"</p>

<p>I began: "Well, Sir, when I was
on the Staff&mdash;&mdash;" He interrupted:
"Now, don't go on to say that you can
organise;" and he shook a finger at me
playfully and was off once more with
an anecdote about an officer in his son's
regiment.</p>

<p>Eventually I found myself being
bowed out in a rather dazed condition.
Only one thing emerged at all clearly
out of the whole interview; and I took
from my pocket a sheet of paper, on
which I had jotted down my most
telling qualifications, and with a stub
of blue pencil regretfully but firmly
biffed out item No 1, Organising
Ability.</p>

<p>I next approached the firm of Walbrook
Bros., armed with a letter from
a man who had once belonged to the
same golf-club as the senior Walbrook
brother.</p>

<p>"I can't read your friend's name,"
said this magnate, "but whoever he
is he seems to think that you are the
sort of man who might be useful in
my business. What can you do?"
and he leaned back patiently in his
chair, finger-tips to finger-tips, but
with all the appearance of one ready to
pounce at my first weak statement.</p>

<p>"For the best part of four years," I
began, "I have been living in France,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He pounced. "Ah, French! I thought
so. Now if you had said Spanish, or
even Russian ..."</p>

<p>He frowned as the thought crossed
his mind that I might yet say either of
them. But I didn't, and he was free to
expatiate on the alleged advantages of
Spanish and a sound commercial education.
The end was that I found myself
once more in the street, this time
erasing the word "Languages" from
my dwindling list.</p>

<p>And so it went on. Mr. Hall, of the
firm of Copt and Basing Hall, begged
me not to speak of any capacity I might
possess for controlling men. (Item
No. 3: Disciplinary Power and Habit of
Command.) He himself was able to do
all the controlling that his staff would
be likely to require. Mr. Throgmorton,
managing director of the firm of Capel
Sons and Threadneedle, Ltd., hoped at
the outset that I would not speak of my
mathematical proficiency. Many men
were inclined to make a fetish of mathematics.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>[pg 489]</span>
He feared I might be one of
them from the fact that I had begun to
speak of (item No. 4) the tabulation and
co-ordination of statistics.</p>

<p>After a week of this sort of thing I
had acquired nothing but experience,
and my experience now gave me an
idea. I drew up a new list of important
firms to which I had received no introductions
at all, and selected one which
I knew was presided over by a man of
almost world-wide fame. Taking my
courage and nothing else in my hands,
I entered the inquiry-office.</p>

<p>"Slip, please," I said briskly to the
youth behind the counter, and he
handed me the customary form. Disregarding
the spaces to be filled in, I
scribbled diagonally across the paper
the name of the great man, and wrote
underneath: "Have called in passing,
and cannot stay many minutes."</p>

<p>This I signed and handed to a messenger,
remarking in a hurried and
off-hand manner, "Say that, if he's
engaged, I'd rather come another day,
as I don't want to miss the 12.5 to
Hatfield."</p>

<p>I had no desire to catch it either;
but Hatfield is where the great man
lives. This was my ingenious method
of getting through the outer defences,
and it worked. The youth behind the
counter supposed I must be a personal
friend (did I mention that I have an
"air" and a power of controlling?...
Ah, yes, item No. 3), and sped the
messenger on his way. Not only so,
but my message must have deceived
the great one himself, for I was admitted
to the Presence immediately.</p>

<p>He stood before me, holding my slip
in his hand, with a puzzled frown on
his face. The frown deepened as he
failed to recognise me.</p>

<p>"You need have no fear," I said; "I
have no letter of introduction." And I
smiled pleasantly at him.</p>

<p>His look of apprehension vanished,
and I continued, unfolding my blue-pencilled
list of accomplishments:&mdash;"Listen:
I am no organiser; my
knowledge of French may be dismissed
as negligible (this from the man with
whom Jeanne Vincent had deigned to
converse in her own tongue!); I profess
no power of controlling my fellow-men;
my mathematical ability isn't
worth a rap, and, as to statistics, I
neither tabulate nor co-ordinate them
with any degree of readiness." Thereupon
I bowed, with hands extended, as
who should say, "You behold me;
that's the sort of man I am."</p>

<p>He smiled faintly. "Excuse me,
but what <i>can</i> you do?"</p>

<p>"That," said I, "is for you to discover.
If, when I shall have worked in
your office for say three months"&mdash;he
started&mdash;"you are unable to find any
use for me, then you are not the kind
of man I take you for." And I drew
myself up, striking what I hoped was a
dignified attitude.</p>

<p>He stared at me for some seconds.</p>

<p>"You have references?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course," I answered, "but I
know enough not to produce them till
they are called for."</p>

<p>Then he pressed a bell. "I am
going," he said, "to introduce you to
my manager. You have certain qualifications
which I think may be useful
to us."</p>

<h3>THE ESSENTIALS OF GOLF.</h3>

<p>"Do you know anything about
golf?" I asked Pottlebury by way of
making conversation with a comparative
stranger, and immediately afterwards
knew I had made a mistake. I
should have inquired, "Do you golf?"
or "Are you a golfer?" and no evasion
would have been possible.</p>

<p>"I should think I do," he replied.
"I suppose there's hardly a course
between here and Strathpeffer that I
haven't visited. English and Scottish,
I know them all."</p>

<p>"And which is your favourite course?"</p>

<p>"That is a difficult question," he remarked
judicially. "Only last night
I was arguing about the comparative
merits of Westward Ho! and St. Andrews.
Both are easily accessible from
the railway, but if you take your car
the latter is to be preferred. You get
your life bumped out of you on those
North Devon roads."</p>

<p>"I wasn't thinking of the travelling
facilities," I observed coldly.</p>

<p>"No, of course. It's what you find
at the other end that counts. Well then,
travelling aside, there is much to be said
for Sandwich. The members' quarters
are comfortable&mdash;very comfortable."</p>

<p>I must have made a disparaging gesture,
for he immediately continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, if it's only lunch you want, I
advise those Lancashire clubs round
Southport. They know how to lunch
in those parts&mdash;Tweed salmon, Welsh
mutton and Whitstable oysters."</p>

<p>"No doubt your judgment is correct,"
I replied, "but I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And at one of them they keep a
real French <i>chef</i> who knows his business.
I wouldn't wish for a better
cuisine anywhere."</p>

<p>"There are other things," I remarked
loftily, "besides those you mention."</p>

<p>"Exactly; that's why I like to see a
good bridge-room attached and enough
tables to accommodate all comers. They
have that at Spotworth. You can often
get a game of poker as well."</p>

<p>"But don't you see," I exclaimed,
"that all these things, are mere accessories
and circumstances?"</p>

<p>"That is true," he murmured; "they
are but frames as it were of the human
interest. After all there's nothing to
equal a crowd of jolly good fellows in
the smoking-room. I've had some excellent
times down at Bambury&mdash;stayed
yarning away to all hours. Some of
the best fellows I ever met belonged to
that club."</p>

<p>"You don't talk at all like a golfer,"
said I.</p>

<p>Pottlebury laughed. "I was forgetting.
If it's whisky you want you
can't beat Dornoch and Islay. We've
nothing in England to touch them.
Why, I've met some of the keenest
golfers of the day at Islay&mdash;nothing
less than a bottle a day apiece."</p>

<p>"Sir," said I severely, "it is clear
that you have never struggled like grim
death with an opponent who was three
up at the turn until you were all square
at the seventeenth, and then found yourself
after a straight drive with an easy
baffy shot to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment," said Pottlebury;
"what exactly <i>is</i> a baffy?"</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<p><i>Monday, June 14th.</i>&mdash;As an Ulster
Member, Mr. <span class="sc">Lindsay</span> protested against
the availability of return-tickets between
Ireland and England having been
reduced from six months to two. Sir
<span class="sc">Eric Geddes</span> explained that the change
had been made to stop the illicit traffic
in return-halves, though he hastened to
disclaim any suggestion that Members
of Parliament were concerned in it.
The grievance is probably not of large
dimensions. It is difficult to understand
why anyone leaving Ireland in
these days should want to go back
there.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span> did not seem to
favour the suggestion, pressed upon him
from many quarters, that the Government
should cause an estimate to be
made of the national income, and then
limit public expenditure to a definite
proportion of that amount. A private
person may cut his coat according to
his cloth, but the Government, he
argued, is unfortunately obliged by circumstances
to reverse the process.
Even so the taxpayer may be forgiven
for thinking that the State costume
still bears some superfluous trimmings.</p>

<p>When economy is proposed, however,
it is not always popular. Sir <span class="sc">John
Butcher</span>, in protesting against the
Government's proposal to sell the
<i>Brussels</i>, the late Captain <span class="sc">Fryatt's</span>
ship, was expressing a wide-spread
feeling. But Colonel <span class="sc">Leslie Wilson</span>
disarmed criticism by pointing out that
if all British vessels with heroic associations
were to be kept as exhibition-ships
a large proportion of the British
mercantile marine would be laid idle.</p>

<p>A few years ago the General Manager
of one of the English railways&mdash;the
late Sir <span class="sc">George Findlay</span>, I think&mdash;declared
that he could look after the whole
of the Irish railways and have three
days a week left for fishing. Nowadays,
I suppose, the Irish lines are not laid
in such pleasant places. At any rate
the best part of two days has been
occupied in deciding whether in the
new scheme for the government of
Ireland they should be administered
by the Central Council or the two Parliaments,
and under the compromise
eventually reached they will be more
or less subject to all three authorities.</p>

<p>The debate was chiefly remarkable
for the evidence it provided that the
Ulstermen are developing into the
strongest of Home Rulers&mdash;almost Sinn
Feiners, according to one of their critics&mdash;where
their own province is concerned.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/493-1-650.png"><img src="images/493-1-320.png" width="320" height="474" alt="THE BUTTON EXPERT." /></a>
<h4>THE BUTTON EXPERT.</h4>

<p>"<span class="sc">About twenty minutes, and I speak
from experience.</span>"&mdash;<i>Mr <span class="sc">Billing.</span></i> </p></div>

<p><i>Tuesday, June 15th.</i>&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span>
had again to withstand attacks upon his
Army uniform proposals, this time on
the ground that the reversion to scarlet
and pipeclay would entail extra labour
and expense upon the private soldier.
His confidence that Mr. Atkins would
not grudge the short time spent on
cleaning his full dress, so closely bound
up with regimental traditions, was
endorsed by Mr. <span class="sc">Billing</span>, who said,
"The time occupied is about twenty
minutes, and I speak from experience."</p>

<p>A statement that the issue of bagpipes
to certain Irish regiments was
under consideration brought protests
from Scottish Members, who evidently
thought that their own national warriors
should have a monopoly of this form
of frightfulness. But Mr. <span class="sc">Churchill</span>
pointed out that the Irish Guards were
already provided with bagpipes, and
Lt.-Commander <span class="sc">Kenworthy</span> horrified
the Scots by declaring that the pipes
were not an indigenous product of their
country, but had been imported from
Ireland many centuries ago.</p>

<p>Further progress was made with the
Government of Ireland Bill. A proposal
to strengthen the representation
of the minority in the Southern Parliament
was sympathetically received by
Mr. <span class="sc">Long</span>, who thought, however, that
the Government had a better method.
As that consists in a proposal to exact
the oath of allegiance from every candidate
for election and to give the <span class="sc">King</span>
in Council power to dissolve any Parliament
in which more than half the
members have not taken the oath, it is
sufficiently drastic. Having regard to
the present disposition of the Sinn
Feiners there seems to be mighty little
prospect of a Parliament in Dublin
before the date known in Ireland as
"Tib's Eve."</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, June 16th.</i>&mdash;In both
Houses Addresses were moved praying
His Majesty to appoint two additional
Judges of the King's Bench Division.
The motions met with some opposition,
principally on the score of
economy, and it was suggested that
no additions to the Bench would be
required if the existing Judges resumed
the old practice of sitting on Saturdays.
This drew from the <span class="sc">Lord Chancellor</span>
the interesting information that the
Judges devoted their Saturdays to
reading "the very lengthy papers that
were contained in their weekly <i>dossier</i>."
It is no doubt the great length of
these documents that accounts for the
peculiar shape of the bag that Mr.
Justice &mdash;&mdash;'s attendant was carrying
when I met him at Sandwich a few
Saturdays ago.</p>

<p>Lord <span class="sc">Birkenhead</span> soothed the economists
by pointing out that the new
Judges would probably more than earn
their salaries of five thousand pounds
a year. In accordance with the prevailing
tendency court-fees are to be
raised, and at Temple Bar as in Savile
Row our suits will cost us more.</p>

<h4>MR. ASQUITH IS DEEPLY STIRRED.</h4></div>

<p>Until Colonel <span class="sc">Leslie Wilson</span> moved
the Second Reading of the Nauru Island
Agreement Bill I don't suppose a dozen
Members of the House of Commons had
ever heard of this tiny excrescence in
the Western Pacific with its wonderful
phosphate deposits. Captured from
the Germans during the War, it is now
the charge of the British Empire, and
the object of the Bill was to confirm
an arrangement by which the deposits
should be primarily reserved for the
agriculturists of Australasia, New Zealand
and the United Kingdom. It produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page494" id="page494"></a>[pg 494]</span>
 a debate of extraordinary ferocity.
Young Tories like Mr. <span class="sc">Ormsby-Gore</span>
vied with old Liberals like Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>
(on whom the phosphates, plus the
Louth election, had a wonderfully
tonic effect) in denouncing the iniquity
of an arrangement by which (as they
said) the principles of the League of
Nations were being thrown over, and
this country was revealed as a greedy
monopolist. Thus assailed both by
friend and foe Mr. <span class="sc">Bonar Law</span> required
all his cool suavity to bring the House
back to a sense of proportion, and to
convince it that in securing a supply
of manure for British farmers the Government
were not committing a crime
against the comity of nations.</p>

<p>Answering questions for the Irish
Government in these days is rather a
melancholy business, but the <span class="sc">Attorney-General</span>
for <span class="sc">Ireland</span> resembles Dr.
<span class="sc">Johnson's</span> friend, in that "cheerfulness
will keep breaking in." Thus he excused
the Government's non-interference with
the Sinn Fein "courts," whose writ
now runs over half Ireland, on the
ground that for all he knew they might
be voluntary courts of arbitration; and
when Major <span class="sc">O'Neill</span> expressed the
hope that he would at least take steps
to protect the British public from the
criminals "transported" by sentence
of these mysterious tribunals he blithely
disclaimed responsibility, and said he
was quite content that they should be
out of Ireland.</p>

<p>Considering the counter-attraction of
the Ascot Gold Cup, Mr. <span class="sc">Balfour</span> had
a surprisingly numerous audience for
his discourse on the League of Nations.
His enumeration and analysis of the
League's various enemies were in his
happiest vein of philosophical humour.
His conclusion was that the League
had much less to fear from its avowed
foes than from its fanatical friends, who
were already attempting to put upon it
tasks for which it was unfitted, and
even to supply it with an International
Police Force. Its proper weapons were
not armies and aircraft, but Delay and
Publicity.</p>

<p>This formula, so reminiscent of Wait
and See, did not prevent Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>
from hinting in the politest manner
that the League was not likely to prevent
the wars of the future unless it
made some effort to stop those now in
progress.</p>

<h3>RAW SOUL STUFF.</h3>

<blockquote class="note"><p>I don't think I have ever read a
short story about a film, so I have
made one up myself.</p></blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Viviana Smith was born in Battersea.
At twelve years old she ran about the
streets with holes in her stockings and
played a complicated game with chalk
squares and a stone. She had the
accent of London streets, which is the
only accent that can pierce through the
noise of London traffic. But she had
hair the colour of marsh-marigolds, a
Vorticist mouth and patent enlargeable
eyes. In the street she made eyes at
errand-boys, and at school she made
eyes so large that there was no room
to dot them.</p>

<p>At the age of seventeen she went in
for the Purple Pomegranate film competition,
and was selected from five
hundred thousand candidates to be a
motion-picture star. She starred some.
At the beginning she played in romantic
comedy films with woodland scenery
and rustic bridges and pools where she
tickled for trout. She tickled so well
that one could almost hear the trout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page495" id="page495"></a>[pg 495]</span>
laugh. Later she played in "crook"
melodrama, where somebody was always
peeping through the door when the
secret patent was being taken out of the
office safe, and where men always kept
arriving in motor-cars and going up
flights of steps with their faces turned
to the audience and going down flights
of steps with their faces turned to the
audience and getting into motor-cars
again. They never missed a step. There
is something about this feat which
holds a cinema audience spellbound.</p>

<p>Later she rode on untamed mustangs
and fell over cliffs gagged and bound,
and sometimes she was even promoted
to slide or twirl into a bakehouse and
tumble with a talented cast of actors
and actresses into a large trough of
dough. When they had wiped the
dough off they all came back into the
bakehouse one after another and tumbled
into the dough-trough again. Repetition
is the soul of wit.</p>

<p>One day Viviana met Ignatius Vavasour,
the poet. For two years he had
worshipped her afar on the screen. He
had seen her in so many reels that
she made him giddy. He had seen her
in <i>Youth's Yodelling May-tide Hour</i>,
length five reels, and in <i>Hate's Hideous
Hand of Crime</i>, length six reels, and
in <i>Gertie Flips the Flap-jack over</i>,
length seven reels and a half. He had
never heard her speak, but he had seen
her beautiful lips ripple into a thousand
artless expressions of grief and joy. He
did not know whether he loved her
most when she was tripping through
a silvan glade, with meadow-sweet in
her hand, or when she was gliding
gracefully over Niagara Falls in a tar-barrel;
when she was cracking the
door of a strong room with a jemmy
or when she was getting the dough out
of her hair with a rake. But as soon
as he had seen her out of the pictures
he knew that he loved her best as she
was. He knew that he could not live
without her. He told her so.</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Vavasour," she protested.</p>

<p>"Call me Iggie," he cried.</p>

<p>"But you have only known me such
a short time," she said. "You have
seen me, you say, a hundred times on
the films, and I daresay you admired me
immensely, but tell me this, Iggie, Is
it my real character that you love?"</p>

<p>"No, no! A thousand times no!"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Then I cannot marry you," she
answered coldly, turning away.</p>

<p>Crushed with disappointment Ignatius
staggered from the room. He had
no thought for poetry now, but wandered
feverishly about the streets,
searching for some mad excitement to
stifle his despair. He played billiards
and <i>vingt-et-un</i>. He took to drugs and
to drink. He even had thoughts of
standing for Parliament. But he soon
found that the sorrow, gnawing at his
heart was one that politics could never
assuage nor alcohol drown, not at least
at the present price of green Chartreuse.</p>

<p>One day as he slouched miserably
along the pavement he saw the advertisement
of a lecture outside the door
of an institute. "The Ideal in Philosophy
and Art," said the placard; and,
scarcely knowing what he did, Ignatius
went in. But the lecturer had barely
begun to expound his theme, which he
did in the following forcible words: "The
categorical subjectivity of all intuitive
apperceptions of the ideal"&mdash;when a
wild light flashed in the poet's eyes
and he started from his seat and rushed
madly from the room. The lecturer
wondered mildly what had happened,
but blinked and went on. What had
happened was that Ignatius Vavasour
was pounding like a prize American
trotter to the nearest telephone box.</p>

<p>"Viviana," he cried an hour later,
when he had got through, "you remember
what you said the day we
met? Is it your real character that I
love? And I said 'No.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, Iggie," she said with a catch
in her voice.</p>

<p>"Did you mean Rabbits, Eggs, Eggs,
Lloyd, or Babbits, Eggs, Albatross,
Lloyd?"</p>

<p>"Albatross," she moaned.</p>

<p>"Well, it is. I mean, I do," he cried.</p>

<p>"Viviana, will you marry me?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Iggie," she answered softly.
"Good-bye."</p>

<h3>IMPORTUNITY.</h3>

<p>When the club secretary first wrote
and told me that it was proposed to
acquire two pictures (one Naval and one
Military), which were to hang in the
club as worthy reminders of the Great
War to future generations&mdash;when he
wrote and told me this, and suggested
(apparently as an afterthought) that a
cheque from me would further the project,
I was content to keep the matter
in view.</p>

<p>When he wrote, some months later,
and told it me all over again, accompanying
the afterthought on this occasion
with a printed subscription form,
I took the trouble to reply, letting him
know that I was keeping the matter
in view.</p>

<p>When he wrote a third time, affording
me a glimpse of the guileless faith
he had in me, I felt genuinely sorry for
the poor chap.</p>

<p>He said there were many possible
reasons to account for the non-arrival
of my cheque. I might, for example,
be abroad, somewhere out of reach of
postal facilities, or perhaps the cheque
had been lost in the post. Of one thing
only he was sure&mdash;there had been no
parsimonious intent on my part.</p>

<p>I was able in some sort to relieve
his mind of anxiety by mentioning that
I was still a resident at the address in
Cheshire under which I last wrote to
him. I even assured him that, so long
as my tailor did not forsake his present
attitude of friendly remonstrance, it
was improbable that I should proceed
abroad. Nor had I as yet any reason
to suspect that great public institution,
the post. The fact was that I still had
the matter in view.</p>

<p>As regards the pictures, I said that I
had a friend who was in love with the
daughter of an A.R.A., and who, in
telling me about a financial controversy
between himself and his prospective
father-in-law, had let slip the information
that a slump in artists' prices was
imminent. In view of this I suggested
that the agreement with the artists
commissioned by the club should for
the present be a verbal one and elastic
in its wording.</p>

<p>In the last part of my letter I reviewed
the history of my own connection
with the club, covering a period of
five years. I recalled the epoch-making
day when I received my first letter
from Mr. Secretary&mdash;a letter acquainting
me of the fact that I was a full-blown
member&mdash;all but, at least. What
was thirty guineas? And each year
since then, I reminded him, I had disbursed
a further ten guineas without a
murmur.</p>

<p>On the other side of the account I
showed in tabulated form all the change
the club had given back:</p>

<p>I pleaded a moral right to dispose of
the balance. I suggested that seventy-three
pounds nine shillings and twopence
three-farthings (waiving the
question of interest) might be sufficient
to buy a third War picture, the interior
of a Government office during the tea-hour,
or something of that sort. I begged
that he would lay the matter before the
Committee.</p>

<p>I am not very hopeful about my

seventy-three pounds odd already on
stationery and postage-stamps.</p>

<p>I think that, if it finds its way into
print, I may send him half the proceeds
of this article. No harm in keeping
the matter in view, at all events.</p>

<h3>MUSICAL NOTES.</h3>

<h4>(<i>By our Modernist Critic</i>).</h4>

<p>A certain amount of dissatisfaction
has been expressed with the Negro
Rhapsody by Mr. <span class="sc">John Powell</span>, performed
by the New York Symphony
Orchestra, at their concert last week.
According to the analytical programme
the composer has sought <i>inter alia</i> to
depict "the degenerative frenzy of a
Voodoo orgy" and "the physical impulses
of the adult human animal," culminating
in "a flood of primal sensualism."
Yet, if the Press is to be believed,
the performance fell lamentably short in
the epileptic quality so finely displayed
by many of the coloured Jazz-band
players now in London. None of the
audience had to be removed; <i>The Morning
Post</i> only speaks of the "becoming
picturesqueness of design" of the Rhapsody;
while <i>The Times'</i> critic did not
care much for it because it took too
long to get to business, and adds that
he was not very sure what its business
exactly was. This, in view of the extremely
explicit statement of the composer's
aim given in the programme,
seems to us most unjust.</p>

<p>Here is a gifted composer with high
and serious aims&mdash;for what could be
more instructive or spiritual than a
musical rendering of "the degenerative
frenzy of a Voodoo orgy"?&mdash;and the
musical critics either evade the issue
by talking vaguely of picturesqueness
or deny that he means business. Verily
the lot of the composer is hard. Quite
recently I heard of a native British
symphonist who had composed a remarkable
orchestral Fantasy dealing
with the psychology of members of the
N.U.R. engaged in the railway transport
of fish and milk. I have not heard
the music, because unfortunately it has
not yet been performed, but I have
read the programme, and nothing more
stimulating can be imagined than the
final section, in which a terrific cannonade
of milk-cans is combined with
a marvellous explosion of objurgation
from the fish-porters on strike. Yet
if it were to be performed <i>The Morning
Post</i> would probably dismiss it with
a few polysyllabic platitudes and <i>The
Times</i> affect ignorance of what it was
all about!</p>

<p>In view of the misconceptions and
misinterpretations to which serious
composers are subject, we are not surprised
to hear that a society has been
formed for the purpose of giving "silent
auditions" of modern masterpieces. No
orchestra nor any instrument will be
employed, but each member of the
audience will be provided with a full
score. The first hour will be devoted
to the study of the music; the audience
will then write down their impressions
for half-an-hour; subsequently the composer
will expound his aims from the
platform; and the price of admission
will be returned to the student whose
impressions accord most closely with
the composer's "programme." In this
way the cost of concert-giving will be
considerably reduced, and it is also
hoped that the consumption of sedative
tablets, which has reached formidable
dimensions amongst frequenters of
symphonic concerts, will be rendered
unnecessary.</p>

<p>Our only criticism of this admirable
scheme is this&mdash;that the number of
amateurs who can read a modern full-score
at sight is still somewhat limited.
The view that "heard melodies are
sweet, but those unheard are sweeter"
might be quoted in support of "silent
auditions" were it not for the unfortunate
fact that <span class="sc">Keats</span>, who expressed it,
is now completely out of fashion with
our emancipated Georgians. But the
broad fact remains that the forces of
reaction are by no means crushed.
The Handel Festival has been revived
at the Crystal Palace; and Handel-worship
is anathema to the Modernist,
as redolent of roast-beef, middle-class
respectability and religious orthodoxy.
Only recently a brilliant writer compared
his oratorios to mothers'-meetings.
The revival of these explosions
of pietistic jumbomania is indeed a sad
set-back to those ardent reformers who
seek to elevate and purify public taste
by the musical delineation of "the degenerative
frenzy of a Voodoo orgy."</p>

<h3>AT THE PLAY.</h3>

<h4>"<span class="sc">Daddalums.</span>"</h4>

<p>This is a play about a Northampton
shoe-manufacturer of Scottish nationality.
There is, of course, nothing quite
like leather, and I can well believe
that the lucrative properties of the boot
trade (notwithstanding its alleged association
with atheistic principles) must
at one time or other have attracted
this prehensile race; yet I doubt if
Northampton, home of the cobbling
industry, ever encouraged a Scot to
penetrate its preserves. Mr. <span class="sc">Louis Anspacher</span>,
who wrote the play, may have
some inside knowledge denied to me,
though his name does not vividly indicate
a Scots origin; but
it is certain, if his <i>Wallace
Craigie</i> really came from
over the border, that he
was no true Scot, for
his dialect showed obvious
traces of Sassenach
pollution.</p>

<p>I have a mind that
moves slowly and I hate
to be hustled at the opening
of a play. I hate an
author to plunge me into
a whirl of movement and
a medley of characters as
if he assumed that I was
intimate with circumstances
known only to
himself and his cast. I
want to be told, very
quietly, where I am, and
if he does not tell me I
become peevish. But,
even if I hadn't been put
off at the start, I don't
think my sympathies
would ever have been
very deeply engaged. I
soon saw that, whatever happened to
anybody, I should easily bear up. Mr.
<span class="sc">Louis Calvert</span> did all that was humanly
possible to correct my indifference, but
his <i>Daddalums</i> (as you might gather
from such a name) was not one of those
heroic figures whose struggles against
the perversity of fate are apt to melt even
the cold hearts of the gods (Olympian).
This old cobbler, suddenly grown rich,
whose one ambition was to make his
son "<i>Tammas</i>" a gentleman (as he understood
the term), at any cost to the
boy's soul, was asking for trouble from
the beginning. And when he got it I
was far less sorry for the old fool than
I was pleased at the chances which this
turn of fortune gave to the versatility
of Mr. <span class="sc">Calvert</span>.</p>

<p>But the interest of the play lies not
so much in the plot&mdash;worked out mechanically,
with one or two saving
touches of ingenuity, to a conventional
conclusion&mdash;as in the character of this
lovable old boot-maker, whose single aim
in life was to give his son the best that
money could buy. His heart, I think,
began by being fairly large, but got contracted
through specialising in this passion.
Snobbery is alien to his nature, but
he becomes a snob for <i>Tammas's</i> sake.
Stubborn and domineering with others,
he is as putty in the boy's hands. He
has no use for his other child&mdash;a girl.
She, like himself, must be sacrificed if
it suits the young gentleman&mdash;as it did.</p>

<p>I won't say that any very nice psychological
subtlety was needed for the
portrayal of a character whose ruling
motive was so clearly advertised, but it
had its lights and shadows, responsive
to changing conditions, and Mr. <span class="sc">Calvert</span>
was quick to seize them all.</p>

<p>The boy's part was too unsympathetic
to be played easily. But he had
one saving virtue; he never practised
his snobbery on the old man who
encouraged it. He still called him
"Daddalums," and that, I take it, was
what the papers would call an "acid
test" of his piety. As his fortunes declined
Mr. <span class="sc">Lister</span> rose to the occasion.
The tighter the corner the better he
coped with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Hendrie's</span> <i>Fergus McLarnie</i>,
whose people must have migrated to
Northampton from the neighbourhood
of Thrums, was an admirable crony;
but he insisted too much and too deliberately
on a Scottish accent that
made for obscurity. In a broader vein
Miss <span class="sc">Agnes Thomas</span> played the part of
<i>Ellen, the Maid</i> (another Scot), with
a humour which even an Englishman
(like myself) found no difficulty in appreciating.
Miss <span class="sc">Edyth Olive</span>, as the
hero's neglected daughter, acted with
a very nice self-repression, which was
all that could be expected of her rather
colourless part.</p>

<p>The first-night audience was very
warm in its appreciation. Yet I must
doubt whether a play that is chiefly
concerned with the highly-developed
paternity of a boot-manufacturer will
make a very poignant appeal to the
sentiment of the public.</p>

<p>For one thing they may find the love-interest
too sketchy. Of the boy's two
fianc&eacute;es one was impossible, and the
other (<i>Rose</i>) just a perfunctory phantom
that flitted vaguely from time to time
across the stage. She
must have known it was
a play of father and son,
where girls didn't really
count. Poor <i>Rose</i>, so unassertive!
How modestly
she kept herself in the
background in that last
scene where <i>Tammas</i>,
having "dreed his weird"
(as they would say in
Northampton) and redeemed
his past, comes
back from Canada, flings
himself into his father's
arms, remains there listening
to a sustained exposition
of parental loyalty,
and only after a
considerable interval remarks
the presence of his
future wife. She took it
very well, but if I know
anything of the British
public it won't be so
easily pleased.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</h4>

<p><i>The Secret Corps</i> (<span class="sc">Murray</span>) is the title of a book on
espionage, before and especially during the War, every page
of which I have read with the greatest possible entertainment&mdash;the
greatest possible, that is, for anyone at home.
To get the real maximum out of Captain <span class="sc">Ferdinand
Tuchy's</span> astonishing anecdotes one would, I suppose, need
to be under a table in Berlin while they were being perused
by the ex-chiefs of Intelligence on the other side. It is a
book so stuffed with good stories and revealed (or partly
revealed) mysteries that I should require pages of quotation
to do it anything like justice. It can certainly be claimed
for Captain <span class="sc">Tuchy</span> that he writes of what he himself knows
at first hand, and that his knowledge, like that of another
expert, is both extensive and peculiar, gleaned as it was
from personal service in Russia, Poland, Austria, Belgium,
France, England, Italy, Salonica, Palestine, Mesopotamia
and several neutral States. Still, absorbing as his book is,
it suffers perhaps from being what its publishers call "the
first authentic and detailed record." One feels now and
then that posterity (which gets all the good things) may
score again in the revelation of yet more amazing details
for which the hour is not yet. Meanwhile, here to go on
with is a fund of thrilling information that will not only
hold your delighted interest, but (if you make haste before
it becomes too widely known) ensure your popularity as
a remunerative diner-out.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>One after Another</i> (<span class="sc">Hutchinson</span>), by Mr. <span class="sc">Stacy Aumonier</span>,
is a tale of social progress: of the steps&mdash;I imagine this is
where the name justifies itself&mdash;by which the son and
daughter of a Camden Town publican rise to higher or at
least more brilliant things. You might suppose this plan
to promise comedy, but the fact is otherwise. Really it is
an angry book, and though there is laughter in places it is
mostly angry laughter, with a sting in it. Somehow,
whether speaking in his own person or through the voice
of his hero, Mr. <span class="sc">Aumonier</span> gives me here (perhaps unjustly)
the impression of having a grievance against life. Yet it
cannot be said that <i>Tom</i> and <i>Laura Purbeck</i> found their
climb from Camden Town unduly arduous, since in a comparatively
short time one has made a position and pots of
money as a fashionable house-decorator, and the other is a
famous concert star and the wife of a marquis. I think my
impression of unamiability must be derived from the fact
that the entire cast contains not one really sympathetic
character. Old <i>Purbeck</i>, who ruled his bar like an autocrat
and believed in honest alcohol (and fortunately for himself
died some years ago), comes nearest to it. <i>Laura</i>, of whom
the author gives us spasmodic glimpses, is vividly interesting,
but repellent. <i>Tom</i>, the protagonist, I found frankly
dull. Perhaps I have dwelt overmuch on defects. Certainly
the story held my attention throughout, even after
my-disappointment at finding nobody to like in it.</p>

<hr />

<p>A lot of diaries make very poor reading, because people
who are conscientious enough to keep them at all keep them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page500" id="page500"></a>[pg 500]</span>
conscientiously and fill them with nothing but facts. Mr.
<span class="sc">Maurice Baring</span> of course has no empty scruples of this
kind, and <i>R.F.C. H.Q. 1914-1918</i> (<span class="sc">Bell and Sons</span>), though
it has plenty of statistics in it and technical details as well,
is in the main a delightful jumble of stunts and talks and
quotations from Mr. <span class="sc">Maurice Baring</span> and other people,
culinary details, troubles about chilblains and wasp-bites,
and here and there an excellently written memoir of some
friend who fell fighting. The main historical fact is, of
course, that our airmen from small beginnings reached a
complete ascendancy at the end of 1916, and then suffered
a set-back, reaching their own again when the mastery of
the Fokker was overcome. The author himself was <i>liaison</i>
officer and interpreter at H.Q., and stuck to General
<span class="sc">Trenchard</span> throughout, although he was urgently requested
to go to Russia. Scores of eminent people make
brief appearances in his book, and the following is a fair
sample of his method:&mdash;"<i>January 3rd, 1917.</i>&mdash;An Army
Commanders' Conference took place at Rollencourt. My
indiarubber sponge was eaten by rats." Happily his diary
escaped.</p>

<hr />

<p>Lieut.-Colonel <span class="sc">John
Buchan</span>, in his now
familiar <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of the
serious historian, has
been officially commissioned
to tell a tale
more thrilling in heroisms,
if perhaps a
trifle less madcap,
than anything his unofficial
imagination
has given us. His latest
volume, <i>The South
African Forces in
France</i> (<span class="sc">Nelson</span>),
though naturally it
does not break much
new ground, still contains
a good deal that
was well worth sifting
from the mass of war
history and is written
with a vigour that
could not be excelled. The proudest claims of the South
Africans are, it seems, that they finished "further East"
when the cease-fire sounded (I wonder if this will go unchallenged),
that they were three times practically exterminated,
and that they were the most modest unit in the field&mdash;the
author of course being solely responsible for letting us know
this last. Their terrible fights, not only at Delville Wood,
but even more at Marri&egrave;re Wood and Messines, are beyond
question amongst the greatest feats of arms of the War, and
on the last two occasions their stand in the face of odds went
far to save the Allied cause in the black months of 1918.
Since, as the author joyously notes, Dutch and English elements
in the South African forces lived and died on the field
like brothers, we may all agree with him, politics or no politics,
that there has been something fundamentally right for
once about the Empire's treatment of their country. This
alone would give the book importance and interest outside
the Southern dominions to which it is first addressed. In
Capetown and Pretoria it will be <i>the</i> history of the War.</p>

<hr />

<p>In <i>John Bull, Junior</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>) Mr. <span class="sc">F. Wren Child</span>
sets out to record the difficulties which a "home-trained
boy encounters at a public school." Whether his picture
of school-life as it was some years ago is true or not,
it is unlikely that there will be keen competition among
public schools to claim the original of <i>St. Lucian's</i>; and I
do not think that tender-hearted mothers need fear that
their own children will be beset by the temptations which
<i>Brant</i> had to encounter, for in his hectic career he was unfortunate
enough to have card-sharpers, whisky-drinkers
and other unusual types of boyhood among his fellow-pupils,
and with such company it is not to be wondered at that
he was more often in than out of trouble. But, since he
helped to solve the mystery which was perplexing <i>St.
Lucian's</i>, it would seem that whatever happened to his
soul he contrived to keep his head. Boys with a taste for
amateur detective work might derive enjoyment from this
tale, and to them I recommend it.</p>

<p><i>Stephen Manaton</i>, heir to great possessions, found that
his wealth and worldly position were slipping away from
him, but as compensation against his losses he had the
supreme satisfaction of discovering that the girl of his
choice loved him solely for himself. So with the best will
in the world I could
not shed tears over
<i>The Manaton Disaster</i>
(<span class="sc">Heath Cranton</span>),
though I admit that
Miss <span class="sc">Phillippa Tyler</span>
does her strenuous
best to set my sympathy
in motion. Possibly
she tries a shade
too hard, and in future
I hope that she will
cut shorter&mdash;or even
cut out completely&mdash;the
soliloquies of her
heroes. Miss <span class="sc">Tyler</span>
has the dramatic
sense, and an author
who can write over
a hundred-and-fifty
words without a full-stop
is not to be
thwarted by trifles;
but she dissipates her
forces and fails to
reach the catastrophic climax at which she apparently aimed.</p>

<hr />

<p>The ways of the humorist are hard indeed, and it must
be particularly exasperating, even if you are a clergyman, to
be told by some disgruntled reviewer, as "<span class="sc">George A. Birmingham</span>"
must, I am afraid, here be told, that his latest,
<i>Good Conduct</i> (<span class="sc">Murray</span>), is not up to standard. <i>Virginia
Tempest</i>, the tomboy, the extremely unworthy recipient of
the good conduct prize at <i>Miss Merridew's</i> academy, has her
points, but her pranks are played with or against such dull
folk: an editor and assistant editor for whom I blush; an
emporium owner who is kinder and wealthier and stupider
than he is diverting; an assistant schoolmistress, a surgeon,
a Futurist-painter, a bishop. None of these worthy people
commands my respect or laughter. The high spirits seem
not entirely genuine. A casual lapse into Brummagem,
I take it.</p>
